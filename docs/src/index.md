<h1> Why ProToPortal.jl? </h1>

Coding and prompt management should be efficient, not a chore. 

ProToPortal.jl was born from a need to make my own coding efforts and general LLM interactions more productive and hassle-free. It's designed to help you manage and automate your workflows more effectively, whether you're on the go or at your desk. 

It's the first Julia-focused GUI (evaluate Julia code, fix it, critique it - or automate it).

<h2> Quick Start Guide </h2>

Clone ProToPortal, instantiate it, enable your desired settings, and streamline your LLM interactions right away:

```julia
using Pkg; Pkg.activate("."); Pkg.instantiate(".")
include("main.jl")
```

Then head to your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to see the app.

For more information, see the [Getting Started](/introduction#Getting-Started) section. Explore all available features in the [Features by Tab](/introduction#Features-by-Tab) section.
